			<h3>Morse Version 2.5: Major Redesign and News</h3>
			<h6>By Hunter Ball</h6>
			<h5>June 29th, 2018</h5>
			<hr>
			<p>Welcome back, Morse enthusiasts! I know it has been a long time since the last update to the Blog and The Morse Project, but good news! We have been working on a new update for a while now, filled with much needed redesigns, bug fixes, and much more!</p>
			<h4>The Redesign</h4>
			<p>The Morse Project UI has been competely redesigned, to make it easier for users to navigate. With the new app drawer in the app, you don't have to keep pressing the back arrow until you find what you are looking for! Every major screen can be accessed from anywhere inside the app!</p>
			<p>Over the past few months, we have received feedback from many users about the UI of the app and the lack of quality navigation. We have been testing new interfaces for the past month, and finally feel we have created the best navigation system for The Morse Project!</p>
			<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
			<p>Version 2.5 also brings many big fixes. Especially fixing the problem between the A and the N. We have received many emails about this bug, and we wanted to bring this, as well as many others, to the forefront of our attention. Many bugs crashing your app or device are now gone, so you can have the best experience with the application!</p>
			<hr>
			<h4>News</h4>
			<p>Many users, especially friends of ours, were concerned over the general lack of updates since January. One of the biggest things we were working on during this time was an iOS version of The Morse Project. However, we regret to inform you all that due to the strict API's and how Apple reveiws it's apps, we will no longer be continueing with the production of The Morse Project for iOS. We were all sad to see such a obstacle we couldn't push past, but we look on to better things, and leave what we cannot fix in the past.</p>
			<p>Now that we have updated The Morse Project to version 2.5, we want to continue supporting it as long as possible. However, as this is our first, and arguably will be our worst, application, we want to continue moving forward.</p>
			<p>The FractylDev team will still work on The Morse Project, but we will be focusing more of our attention into bigger and better projects, for the Google Play store and The App Store. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>
