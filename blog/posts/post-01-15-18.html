			<h3>Morse Version 2.0: New Features and UI Redesigns</h3>
			<h6>By Hunter Ball</h6>
			<h5>January 15th, 2018</h5>
			<hr>
			<p>Hello everyone! As many of you may already know, Morse was just released, and our team has already been hard at work developing amazing updates for all of you! The first of which arrived today, fixing a lot of bugs and UI problems, as well as adding a few really useful features!</p>
			<p>Morse is only in it's infancy, and there are a lot of features we want to add later, once the app is more commercially ready, but our amazing team has been working hard putting out an update that will definitely help make Morse a more integral part of your life!</p>
			<p>Morse now has the ability to only vibrate the contact name or first initial of their name. If you are more of a beginner, this is a great option to start learning the basics of morse. Plus, it's much more time effecient, so you don't need to feel your phone for a minute or two for the entire message.</p>
			<p>You can now also set the speed of the vibrations, so if you are an expert, you can listen to a whole messages in ten seconds, and if you are just starting, you can set the speed slower so you can read out all the messages.</p>
			<p>The Morse App is available on Google Play, and will be available on iOS soon. You can get it for Android devices running Android 6.0 or later with the link below!</p>
