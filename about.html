				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p>Fractyl Development was created by six friends who loved programming, developing, and designing software, applications, and websites. We all came together to create Morse, for a tech competition at our high school. </p>
				<br>
				<p>While creating Morse, we all realized we have a passion for developing, and so we came together to form Fractyl Development. </p>
				<br>
				<p>Fractyl Development focuses on creating amazing products with amazing functionality and beautiful design, that stands out in this world of technology.</p>
