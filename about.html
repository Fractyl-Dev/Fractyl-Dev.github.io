				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p>FractylDev was created by six friends who loved programming, developing, and designing software, applications, and websites. We all came together to create Morse, for a tech competition at our school. </p>
				<br>
				<p>As we designed the prototype stages of Morse, we began coming up with other app ideas, and eventually, we decided an app development company would further our skills and bring our products to the world better than any of us could alone. We began designing FractylDev. Each of us have different skills that worked together, and we believed we could make FractylDev a stand out company..</p>
				<br>
				<p> This company was founded on the principle of bringing people and things together to create something unique, and we don't plan on stopping any time soon. FractylDev focuses on creating amazing products with amazing functionality and beautiful design, that stands out in this world of technology. We develop for both iOS and Android, as well as game development using Unity and website development.</p>
				<br>
				<p>FractylDev is relatively new, but we are already hard at work creating many amazing products. We prioritize user experience over everything, and we make sure our apps are commercially ready.</p>
				<br>
				<p>If you are looking for an amazing app developer, look no further than FractylDev.</p>
